**Agently Daily News Collector** is an open-source LLM based automatically news collecting workflow showcase project powered by [**_<font color = "red">Agent</font><font color = "blue">ly</font>_** AI application development framework](https://github.com/Maplemx/Agently).

You can use this project to generate almost any topic of news collection. All you need to do is simply input the field topic of your news collection. Then you wait and the AI agents will do their jobs automatically until a high quality news collection is generated and saved into a markdown file.

News collection file examples:

## How to Use

### Step 1: Clone this repo

Run this command in shell:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AgentEra/Agently-Daily-News-Collector.git
```

### Step 2: Edit settings YAML file

You can find [`SETTINGS.yaml`](https://github.com/AgentEra/Agently-Daily-News-Collector/blob/main/SETTINGS.yaml) file in the project dir.

Input your model's API key and change other settings as your wish.

If you want to use other model, you can read [this document](https://github.com/Maplemx/Agently/blob/main/docs/guidebook/application_development_handbook.ipynb) or [this Agently official website page](http://agently.tech/features/model_request.html) to see how to set the settings.

### Step 3: Start

Because this project is a Python project, you need to install Python first. You can find installation instruction on [Python official website](https://www.python.org/).

At the first time to run this project, you should use this command in shell to download and install dependency packages:

```shell
pip install -r path/to/project/requirements.txt
```

Wait until the dependency packages are installed then use this command in shell to start the generation process.

```shell
python path/to/project/app.py
```

You will see a tip `[Please input the topic of your daily news collection]:`.

Input your topic idea about the field of news that you want to collect, then you're good to go.

During the process, there'll be some logs printed to shell to present what tasks are done like this:

```shell

```

Whole process will take some time, so just relax and have some rest‚òïÔ∏è.

### Step 4: Get your news collection markdown file!

When the process is done finally, you will see a tip like this with markdown text that generated printed on screen:

```shell
2024-05-02 21:57:20,521 [INFO] [Markdown Generated]
```

Then you can find a markdown file named `<collection name> <generated date>.md` in your project dir.

Enjoy it! üòÑ
